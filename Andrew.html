          <h2>About Aj:</h2>
          <p>
            Hi my name is Andrew but everyone calls me Aj! I major in computer
            science and play volleyball. On Lost Media I have a few segments,
            but my favorite is when I cover artist who have under 100k streams,
            to give them a spotlight so that their songs don't become lost
            media. If you ever see me around feel free to say what's up!
